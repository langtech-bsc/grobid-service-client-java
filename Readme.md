# Simple Java client for GROBID REST services

This Java project can be used to process in an efficient concurrent manner a set of PDF in a given directory by the [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) service. Results are written in a given output directory and include the resulting XML TEI representation of the PDF. 

## Build and run

You need first to install and start the *grobid* service, latest stable version, see the [documentation](http://grobid.readthedocs.io/). It is assumed that the server will run on the address `http://localhost:8070`. You can change the server address by editing the file `grobid-client.properties`.

Build the client:

> mvn clean install

## Usage

Parameters: 

* `-in`: path to the directory containing the PDF files to process 

* `-out`: path to the directory where to put the results

* `-exe`: GROBID service to be used, one of `[processFulltextDocument, processHeaderDocument, processReferences]` (default `processFulltextDocument`)

* `-n`: concurrency for service usage (default 10)

For example: 

> java -jar target/org.grobid.client-0.5.4-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar -in ~/tmp/in2 -out ~/tmp/out -exe processFulltextDocument

This command will process all the PDF files present in the input directory (files with extension `.pdf` only) with the `processFulltextDocument` service of GROBID, and write the resulting XML TEI files under the output directory, reusing the file name with a different file extension (`.tei.xml`), using the default `10` concurrent workers.

> java -jar target/org.grobid.client-0.5.4-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar -in ~/tmp/in2 -out ~/tmp/out -n 20 -exe processHeaderDocument

This command will process all the PDF files present in the input directory (files with extension `.pdf` only) with the `processHeaderDocument` service of GROBID, and write the resulting XML TEI files under the output directory, reusing the file name with a different file extension (`.tei.xml`), using `20` concurrent workers.

## Docker
Start grobid service
```bash
make deploy
```


### Build Docker Image
To build the Docker image, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:


```bash
docker build -t projecteaina/grobid-client-java:1.0 .
```

### Run Docker Container
Once the Docker image is built, you can use the following command to run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -v path/to/input_pdfs:/app/input -v path/to/output:/app/output projecteaina/grobid-client-java:1.0 -in ./input -out ./output -n 4 -exe processFulltextDocument
```

## Benchmarking

Full text processing of __136 PDF__ (total 3443 pages, in average 25 pages per PDF) on Intel Core i7-4790K CPU 4.00GHz, 4 cores (8 threads), 16GB memory, n being the concurrency parameter:

| n  | runtime (s)| s/PDF | PDF/s |
|----|------------|-------|-------|
| 1  | 210.9  | 1.55      | 0.64 |
| 2  | 117.2  | 0.86      | 1.16 | 
| 3  | 85.5   | 0.63      | 1.59 |
| 5  | 69.8   | 0.51      | 1.95 |
| 8  | 60.9   | 0.45      | 2.23 |
| 10 | 60.2   | 0.44      | 2.26 |

![Runtime Plot](resources/20180929081805.png)

As complementary info, GROBID processing of header of the 136 PDF and with `n=10` takes 3.82 s (more than 15 times faster than the complete full text processing because only the two first pages of the PDF are considered), 35.60 PDF/s. In similar conditions, extraction and structuring of bibliographical references takes 27.9 s, 4.87 PDF/s.

## Todo

Benchmarking with more files (e.g. million ISTEX PDF). Also implement existing GROBID services for text input (date, name, affiliation/address, raw bibliographical references, etc.). Better support for parameters (including elements where to put coordinates).
